  util/       Gerneral purpose utilities


FREEBSD
--------

1. If you want to set the bbs in chroot environment,
   you'll need:

    /usr/share/misc/termcap
    /usr/share/misc/termcap.db

   Just copy or mount these file onto the bbs home directory.

2.  ## Please use des-crypt ##

   Because FreeBSD by default uses md5-crypt, not des-crypt,
   with our bbs program, please use des-crypt. You need not
   change your system library. Just take a copy of 'libdescrypt.a'.
   When linking the bbs program, make the lib file visible.
